Creating a Netflix-like homepage involves structuring the page with HTML and styling it with CSS. The HTML includes sections like the header with the Netflix logo and sign-in button, a hero section with a background image and sign-up form, and additional sections for features. CSS is used to style these elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design. For example, the hero section might have a large, centered title and a background image that covers the entire section, creating an engaging first impression for visitors.
